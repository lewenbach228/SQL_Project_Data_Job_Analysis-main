### 6. Are Remote Data Scientist Job Offers Better Paid?

To compare the average salaries of remote and on-site Data Scientist positions, we analyzed job postings while focusing only on those with specified salaries (excluding null values).

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN job_work_from_home = true THEN 'Remote'
        ELSE 'On-Site'
    END AS job_location,
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    job_work_from_home
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC;
```

| Job Location | Average Salary ($) |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Remote       | 144,398.25         |
| On-Site      | 134,306.56         |


The analysis shows that remote Data Scientist positions offer a higher average salary ($144,398.25) compared to on-site positions ($134,306.56). This information highlights the potential financial benefits of remote work opportunities in the field of data science.

### 7. Do Data Scientist Positions Without a Degree Requirement Impact Salary?

To compare the average salaries of Data Scientist positions with and without degree requirements, we analyzed job postings while focusing only on those with specified salaries (excluding null values).

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN job_no_degree_mention = true THEN 'No Degree Required'
        ELSE 'Degree Required'
    END AS degree_status,
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    job_no_degree_mention
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC;
```

| Degree Status      | Average Salary ($) |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
